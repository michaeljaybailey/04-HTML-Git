### 4. Students Do: Using Git from the very start of a project (Demo) (20 min)

* Using [04-HTML_Git](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/tree/master/01-Class-Content/01-html-git-css/01-Activities/04-HTML_Git) as an example:

* Create New Blank Repo for the activity, on GitHub. (Include default ReadME file)

* Clone the blank repo you just created, on GitHub.

* Display git status and talk about how to use that to help you view the local repository changes. (you'll use again in a moment)

* Add a few files (not all) from the activity to the cloned folder (which should be initially empty, with a default ReadMe file)

* Display git status and talk about how to use that to help you view the local repository changes.

* Commit the changes that you "added to your staging area", leave a commit message reflecting this.

* Display git status and talk about how to use that to help you view the local repository changes.

* Use git push to push it to the remote repository

* Show the updated repository on GitHub

* Add the remaining files for the activity

* Commit them, and push them.
